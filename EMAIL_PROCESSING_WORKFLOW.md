## Overview

OnlyJobs uses a sophisticated **Thread-Aware 3-Stage LLM System** to process job application emails. This system leverages Gmail's threading, processes emails chronologically, and intelligently groups related emails while minimizing LLM calls.

### Key Principles
- **Thread-First**: Gmail threads are treated as single jobs
- **Chronological Processing**: ALWAYS process oldest → newest
- **Smart Grouping**: Company-based grouping for orphan emails
- **Minimal LLM Calls**: Only classify first email in threads

## The Three-Stage LLM System

### Stage 1: Binary Classification
**Purpose**: Determine if an email is job-related  
**Input**: Email subject and body  
**Output**: `{"is_job": true/false}`  
**Speed**: ~1.5 seconds  
**When it runs**:
- First email of EVERY thread
- EVERY orphan email (no thread)

**Early Exit**: If `is_job: false`, skip Stages 2 & 3 (saves ~3.5 seconds)

### Stage 2: Information Extraction
**Purpose**: Extract job details from confirmed job emails  
**Input**: Email subject and body (only job emails)  
**Output**: `{"company": "X", "position": "Y", "status": "Applied/Interview/Offer/Declined"}`  
**Speed**: ~2 seconds  
**When it runs**:
- Only on emails where Stage 1 returned `is_job: true`
- For threads, only on the first email

### Stage 3: Job Matching
**Purpose**: Determine if two job emails refer to the same position  
**Input**: Two job objects with company, position, status  
**Output**: `{"same_job": true/false}`  
**Speed**: ~1 second  
**When it runs**:
- ONLY for orphan emails (emails without threads)
- ONLY within the same company group
- NEVER for threaded emails (they're already grouped)

**Smart Matching**: Intelligently matches variations like "Google SWE" with "Google Software Engineer"

## Detailed Processing Pipeline

### Step 1: Email Fetching
```javascript
// Gmail API returns emails NEWEST first by default
const emails = await gmail.users.messages.list({
  userId: 'me',
  q: `after:${dateFilter}`,
  maxResults: batchSize
});
// Returns: [Dec 5 Interview, Dec 1 Application] (newest first)
```

### Step 2: Critical Reversal
```javascript
// MUST reverse to process chronologically
emails.reverse(); 
// Now: [Dec 1 Application, Dec 5 Interview] (oldest first)
// This ensures proper job lifecycle tracking
```

### Step 3: Thread Grouping
```javascript
const threads = new Map();
const orphans = [];

for (const email of emails) {
  if (email.threadId) {
    if (!threads.has(email.threadId)) {
      threads.set(email.threadId, []);
    }
    threads.get(email.threadId).push(email);
  } else {
    orphans.push(email); // No thread = orphan
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Process Threaded Emails (80% of all emails)
```javascript
for (const [threadId, threadEmails] of threads) {
  // Sort within thread: oldest → newest
  threadEmails.sort((a, b) => a.date - b.date);
  
  // Classify ONLY the first email
  const firstEmail = threadEmails[0];
  const classification = await runStage1And2(firstEmail);
  
  if (classification.is_job) {
    // ALL emails in thread inherit this classification
    createJob({
      ...classification,
      emails: threadEmails, // All emails belong to this job
      threadId: threadId
    });
  }
}
// Stage 3 NEVER runs for threaded emails
```

### Step 5: Process Orphan Emails (20% of all emails)
```javascript
// Group orphans by company domain first
const companyGroups = groupByCompanyDomain(orphans);

for (const [domain, companyEmails] of companyGroups) {
  // Sort by date: oldest → newest
  companyEmails.sort((a, b) => a.date - b.date);
  
  const jobs = [];
  for (const email of companyEmails) {
    // Run Stage 1 & 2
    const classification = await runStage1And2(email);
    
    if (classification.is_job) {
      // Try to match with existing jobs IN THIS COMPANY ONLY
      let matched = false;
      for (const existingJob of jobs) {
        // Stage 3: Job matching
        const matchResult = await runStage3(classification, existingJob);
        if (matchResult.same_job) {
          existingJob.emails.push(email);
          matched = true;
          break;
        }
      }
      
      if (!matched) {
        jobs.push(createNewJob(classification, email));
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Critical Implementation Details

### 1. Processing Order is NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Gmail returns newest → oldest
- We MUST reverse to oldest → newest
- This ensures Application → Interview → Offer progression
- Without this, job timeline is backwards

### 2. Thread Trust
- Gmail's threading is extremely reliable
- If emails are in same thread, they ARE the same job
- No need for Stage 3 matching on threads
- This assumption saves 70-80% of LLM calls

### 3. Company Grouping Strategy
```javascript
// Example grouping
{
  "google.com": [orphanEmail1, orphanEmail2],
  "meta.com": [orphanEmail3],
  "amazon.com": [orphanEmail4, orphanEmail5]
}
// Stage 3 only compares within each group
// Google emails never compared with Meta emails
```

### 4. Status Progression Logic
```javascript
const STATUS_PRIORITY = {
  'Applied': 1,
  'Interview': 2,
  'Offer': 3,
  'Declined': 4
};

// Status only moves forward
if (newPriority > currentPriority) {
  updateStatus(newStatus);
}
// Never: Offer → Applied (backwards)
```

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple threads concurrently
- **Early Exit**: Non-job emails stop after Stage 1
- **Cache Results**: Store classifications for 7 days
- **Company Pre-filter**: Use domain to limit Stage 3 comparisons

## Performance Metrics

### Without Thread-Aware System (Naive Approach)
- 1000 emails = 1000 Stage 1 calls
- ~300 job emails = 300 Stage 2 calls  
- ~300 job emails = 44,850 Stage 3 comparisons (n*(n-1)/2)
- **Total**: ~46,150 LLM calls

### With Thread-Aware System
- 200 threads + 200 orphans = 400 Stage 1 calls
- ~60 job threads + 60 job orphans = 120 Stage 2 calls
- ~60 orphans in ~20 companies = ~60 Stage 3 calls (only within companies)
- **Total**: ~580 LLM calls

### Result: 98.7% Reduction in LLM Calls!

## Examples

### Example 1: Typical Job Application Thread
```
Thread_123:
- Email 1: "Application Confirmation - Google SWE" (Nov 1)
- Email 2: "Interview Invitation - Google" (Nov 5)  
- Email 3: "Final Round - Google Engineering" (Nov 10)
- Email 4: "Offer Letter - Google" (Nov 15)

Processing:
1. Classify Email 1 → is_job: true
2. Extract from Email 1 → company: Google, position: SWE, status: Applied
3. Emails 2, 3, 4 automatically inherit → Same job
4. Check latest email for status → Update to "Offer"
Result: 1 job, 2 LLM calls (Stage 1 + 2)
```

### Example 2: Orphan Email Matching
```
Orphan Emails (no threads):
- Email A: "Google Software Engineer Opening" (from: recruiter@google.com)
- Email B: "Google SWE Role" (from: hr@google.com)
- Email C: "Meta Backend Engineer" (from: jobs@meta.com)

Processing:
1. Group by domain → google.com: [A, B], meta.com: [C]
2. Process Google group:
   - Email A → is_job: true → extract details → new job
   - Email B → is_job: true → extract details → Stage 3 with A → same_job: true → merge
3. Process Meta group:
   - Email C → is_job: true → extract details → new job (no comparison needed)
Result: 2 jobs, 7 LLM calls (3 Stage 1 + 3 Stage 2 + 1 Stage 3)
```

### Example 3: Mixed Threads and Orphans
```
Inbox:
- Thread_A: 3 emails about Google position
- Thread_B: 2 emails about Meta position
- Orphan: 1 email about Google internship
- Orphan: 1 email about Amazon role

Processing:
1. Thread_A → Classify first → Google job
2. Thread_B → Classify first → Meta job  
3. Orphan Google → Classify → Compare with Thread_A → different position → new job
4. Orphan Amazon → Classify → No other Amazon jobs → new job
Result: 4 jobs, 8 LLM calls total
```

## Implementation Files

- **Main Processor**: `electron/thread-aware-processor.js`
- **3-Stage Classifier**: `electron/llm/two-stage-classifier.js` (includes Stage 3)
- **Gmail Integration**: `electron/gmail-multi-auth.js`
- **Database Schema**: Thread support in `jobs` table

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **DO NOT** process newest → oldest (breaks timeline)
2. **DO NOT** run Stage 3 on threaded emails (waste of resources)
3. **DO NOT** compare jobs across different companies (pointless)
4. **DO NOT** classify every email in a thread (redundant)
5. **DO NOT** update status backwards (Offer → Applied)

## Testing the Workflow

```bash
# Test the complete flow
npm run test:workflow

# Test with specific number of emails
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 node test-workflow.js --emails=100

# Test with specific date range
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 node test-workflow.js --days=30
```

## Future Optimizations

1. **Parallel Thread Processing**: Process multiple threads simultaneously
2. **Smart Caching**: Cache Stage 3 results for common job title variations
3. **Batch Stage 1**: Process multiple first emails in single LLM call
4. **Thread Prediction**: Use subject similarity to group orphans into threads
5. **Incremental Sync**: Only process new emails since last sync
